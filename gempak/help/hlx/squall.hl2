     SQUALL

     SQUALL is the length of the squall line used for the air and
     moisture flux calculations.The default value is 20000 m.
     The coordinate rotation is implied in the calculation of the
     fluxes, since only the V component of the wind is used in the
     equations. Therefore, ROTATE should be set such that the long
     axis of the sqall line is along X-axis.
