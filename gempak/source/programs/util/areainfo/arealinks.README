arealinks.README

This package includes a script, called arealinks, and a copy of the 
mcInfo program.  The script uses mcInfo to open the AREA files on your
disk, read the header, and then create links defining user-friendly names 
for each AREA file.  This will help you in matching the date and time
of your satellite image files and any data you might want to overlay on
top of the images.

Arealinks sets up links to the directory containing McIDAS AREA files.  
The links have the TDDHH file naming convention for the satellite image 
files, where T is type (i=IR, v=VIS, w=Water Vapor, f=Floater and 
c=Composite (antartic)), DD is the 2 digit day, and HH is the two digit 
hour.  For example, here's a directory listing from my $AREA directory
for October 4, 1994:

c0309 c0400 f0406 f0412 i0405 i0411 v0323 v0412 w0312 w0403
c0312 c0403 f0408 f0413 i0406 i0412 v0400 v0414 w0315 w0406
c0315 c0406 f0409 f0414 i0408 i0414 v0401 v0415 w0318 w0409
c0318 c0409 f0410 f0415 i0409 i0415 v0402 v0416 w0321 w0412
c0321 c0412 f0411 f0416 i0410 i0416 v0403 v0417 w0400 w0415

You may modify this script to change the naming convention if 
you'd like.  

The date and time used in the link is determined by opening the AREA file 
and extracting the valid time information using a program called mcInfo
written by Glenn Davis of the Unidata Program Center.  mcInfo is included
with this software package.  If you are currently running mcInfo for WXP 
or McIDAS, you do not need to rebuild the mcInfo executable.

Note, you must have write permission in the GEMPAK area directory. 

Run the script from cron after products arrive:

#Create links from area files to user-friendly names 
21 * * * * /bin/csh /home/nawips/bin/arealinks vis 1>>/dev/null 2>&1
33 * * * * /bin/csh /home/nawips/bin/arealinks ir 1>>/dev/null 2>&1
40 * * * * /bin/csh /home/nawips/bin/arealinks float 1>>/dev/null 2>&1
55 * * * * /bin/csh /home/nawips/bin/arealinks wv 1>>/dev/null 2>&1
59 * * * * /bin/csh /home/nawips/bin/arealinks comp  1>>/dev/null 2>&1


usage:  arealinks [type]
                  where type = vis   Visible area files (0120-0129)
                               ir    IR area files (0130-0139)
                               wv    Water Vapor area files (0170-0179)
                               float Floater images (0160-0169)
                               comp  Antartic composite images (0190-0199)

 NOTE TO USER:  IN 1995 YOU MUST CHANGE ALL OCCURANCES OF THE NUMBER 94 
 TO 95 IN THE AREALINKS SCRIPT.  THE SED SUBSTITUTE COMMAND CURRENTLY 
 KEYS ON THE NUMBER 94 TO CREATE THE LINK.  SIMPLY CHANGE 94 TO 95, AND 
 THE SCRIPT WILL KEEP WORKING!

To install this package, untar it somewhere in your GEMPAK distribution.
(We recommend the $NAWIPS directory):

zcat arealinks.tar.Z | tar xvf -

This will create a directory called arealinks.  In this directory, 
you will find the mciInfo source code, the script arealinks, and
this README file.  Edit the Makefile to configure it for your machine
and run:

make all
make install
make clean

The make install command will install the mcInfo executable and 
the arealinks script in the directory you specified in the Makefile
as your BINDIR.  If you already have mcInfo compiled for use with
WXP or McIDAS, you can copy the arealinks scripts to your bin
directory by hand, and simply use the copy of mcInfo you already
have installed.

Finally, you must add entries to your cron table to run the
arealinks script as your AREA files arrive.  A sample crontable
is included above.

Question & comments should be directed to me.
