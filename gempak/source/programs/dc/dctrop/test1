TROPICAL STORM BLANCA DISCUSSION NUMBER   6
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MIAMI FL
8 PM PDT TUE JUN 10 1997

BLANCA HAS BEEN MOVING WESTWARD...ABOUT 16 KNOTS...WHILE LOCATED
SOUTH OF A STRONG HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE. THIS TRACK IS EXPECTED TO
CONTINUE FOR AT LEAST 24 HOURS OR SO.  THEREAFTER...BLANCA SHOULD
SLOW DOWN CONSIDERABLY SINCE THE STEERING CURRENTS ARE FORECAST TO
COLLAPSE. AN APPROACHING MID-LATITUDE SHORTWAVE...FORECAST BY THE
AVN MODEL...SHOULD FORCE BLANCA TO MOVE ON A MORE NORTHWESTERLY
TRACK BEYOND 48 HOURS AND THIS IS INDICATED IN THE OFFICIAL
FORECAST. 

IN RESPONSE TO THE CHANGE IN THE STEERING FLOW...BAM MODELS AND LBAR
TURN BLANCA TO THE NORTHWEST AND EVEN TO THE NORTH BY THE END OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD.   NUMERICAL GUIDANCE RECEIVED FROM UNIVERSITY OF
MEXICO...UNAM...SHOWS A TRACK VERY SIMILAR TO THE U.S. DYNAMICAL
MODELS AT LEAST TO 60 HOURS.  CLIPER MAINTAINS BLANCA ON A WESTWARD
TRACK FOR DAYS WHILE THE GFDL DISSIPATES THE STORM IN 24 HOURS. 

IN SPITE OF THE VERY WARM WATERS AND THE GOOD UPPER-LEVEL
OUTFLOW...BLANCA REFUSES TO INTENSIFY.  WITH SUCH A FAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENT...THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION BUT TO FORECAST
STRENGTHENING. HOWEVER...THE UK...AVN GLOBAL MODELS AND THE GFDL
FORECAST WEAKENING.  MAYBE THESE MODELS ARE CAPTURING FEATURES THAT
I AM NOT ABLE TO DEPICT FROM CONVENTIONAL TOOLS COMMONLY USED TO
PREDICT CHANGES IN INTENSITY.
